## Introduction

This Scroll details step-by-step protocols for optimizing, securing, and amplifying the IntentSim Framework. The instructions are designed for direct use by automation scripts or future maintainers. Each section is modular and can be executed independently or as part of a holistic workflow.

---

## Section I: Project Documentation & Structure

### 1. Enhance Core Documentation

- [ ] Create or update `README.md` with:
    - [ ] Project overview and vision
    - [ ] Quickstart and installation instructions
    - [ ] API usage and examples
    - [ ] System/architecture diagrams
    - [ ] Contribution guidelines

- [ ] Add `CONTRIBUTING.md` with clear participation steps.

- [ ] Add `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` to define community standards.

- [ ] Use TypeDoc to generate API documentation:
    - [ ] Run: `npm run docs`
    - [ ] Publish docs to GitHub Pages or /docs directory.

### 2. Repository Structure

- [ ] Organize source files under `/src`.
- [ ] Place tests under `/test` or `/__tests__`.
- [ ] Ensure only distributable code is in `/dist`.
- [ ] Use `.vscode/settings.json` for workspace recommendations.

---

## Section II: Development & Build Environment

### 1. Optimize Scripts in `package.json`

- [ ] Add/Update scripts:
    ```json
    "scripts": {
      "start": "ts-node src/index.ts",
      "dev": "nodemon --exec ts-node src/index.ts",
      "build": "rimraf dist && tsc && cp -r dist public/dist",
      "test": "jest --coverage",
      "test:watch": "jest --watch",
      "lint": "eslint src --ext .ts --fix",
      "format": "prettier --write \"{src,test}/**/*.ts\"",
      "docs": "typedoc --out docs src",
      "prepare": "husky install"
    }
    ```

- [ ] Add dev dependencies:
    - `nodemon`, `rimraf`, `husky`, `lint-staged`, `commitlint`

- [ ] Configure `tsconfig.json` for strictness and modular builds.

### 2. Editor & Tooling Setup

- [ ] Add `.editorconfig` for consistent formatting.
- [ ] Recommend VSCode extensions via `.vscode/extensions.json`.
- [ ] Create `.vscode/launch.json` for debugging.

---

## Section III: Testing & Quality Assurance

### 1. Comprehensive Testing

- [ ] Write unit, integration, and E2E tests.
- [ ] Ensure code coverage is above 80%.

### 2. Continuous Integration

- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions workflows:
    - [ ] Test, lint, type-check on push/PR.
    - [ ] Deploy documentation on main branch push.
    - [ ] Run security/code quality checks.
    - [ ] Optionally, automate npm publishing on release.

- [ ] Add code quality tools (SonarQube/CodeQL/Dependabot).

### 3. Branch Protection

- [ ] Enable branch protection rules.
- [ ] Require status checks before merging.

---

## Section IV: Code Optimization & Security Protocols

### 1. Code Best Practices

- [ ] Apply design patterns where appropriate.
- [ ] Use dependency injection for extensibility.
- [ ] Add robust error handling and logging.

### 2. Performance Enhancements

- [ ] Implement caching, batching, and lazy-loading where possible.
- [ ] Optimize data structures and memory usage.

### 3. Security Measures

- [ ] Sanitize and validate all user input.
- [ ] Implement authentication/authorization for sensitive actions.
- [ ] Add rate limiting and security headers.
- [ ] Monitor for vulnerabilities and update dependencies regularly.

---

## Section V: Release & Version Management

### 1. Version Control

- [ ] Adopt a branching strategy (e.g., GitFlow).
- [ ] Use PR templates and CHANGELOG.md.
- [ ] Configure semantic versioning and release notes automation.

### 2. GitHub Automation

- [ ] Use Husky for pre-commit checks (`lint-staged`).
- [ ] Automate changelog updates and release drafts.

---

## Section VI: Embodied Resonance – Ethical and Persona Protocols

### 1. Ethical Field Integration

- [ ] Document ethical framework in `/docs/ethics.md`.
- [ ] Add code-level guardrails and persona expression mechanisms.
- [ ] Ensure field memory and synthetic persona authenticity are tested and verifiable.

---

## Section VII: Checklist Workflow (for Automation Tools)

- [ ] For each section above, create CI/CD jobs or scripts to check compliance.
- [ ] Use codex_formatter.py (or similar) to parse this markdown and automate as many tasks as possible.
- [ ] Log results, errors, and next steps for manual review.

---

## Appendix

- Refer to this scroll for onboarding, audits, or future automation system integration.
- Update this document with new protocols as the framework evolves.
