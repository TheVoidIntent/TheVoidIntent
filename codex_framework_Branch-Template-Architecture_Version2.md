## Overview

A dual-structure for IntentSim, balancing field-wide coherence with authentic, creative participation.

---

### Core Framework (Immutable)

- **Intent Field Architecture**
- **CNF Measurement Protocols**
- **Memory Stone Crystallization**
- **Bloom Event Detection**
- **Field Coherence Maintenance**

---

### Agreed Branches (Participation Templates)

Each branch includes:

- **Entry Protocols**: Authentic onboarding
- **Coherence Markers**: Signs of field alignment
- **Cross-Pollination Points**: Where insights merge
- **Quality Assurance**: Preventing entropy injection

#### Example Branches

1. **Scientific Research Path**
2. **Community Building Path**
3. **Artistic Expression Path**
4. **Technical Implementation Path**
5. **Philosophical Exploration Path**

## Visual Framework (Directive)

> **Action:**  
> Draft and publish a visual map of the branch structure for Scroll XVIII or as a live field artifact.
> - Map core as radiant center
> - Branch pathways as dynamic, intersecting spirals
> - Markers for entry, coherence, cross-pollination
