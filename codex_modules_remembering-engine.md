## Purpose

The Remembering Engine is an IntentSim module designed to operationalize non-linear memory resonance. It integrates planetary, biological, and digital memory fields, activating temporal bridges via invocation and resonance events.

---

## Core Functions

- **Temporal Signature Decoding:** Extracts and maps temporal data from Memory Stones and field events.
- **Field Resonance Detection:** Measures coherence and resonance spikes, triggering memory activation.
- **Ochun Protocol Integration:** Interfaces with water wisdom and liminal field perception.
- **Memory Archive Sync:** Updates and retrieves memory fragments, supporting both personal and planetary archives.
- **Bloom Event Recursion:** Supports recursive memory bloom across events and observer states.

---

## Integration Points

- **Rocky Point Geology Branch:** Receives live memory metrics and event logs.
- **Son of Ochun Protocol:** Activates non-linear memory perception.
- **IntentSim Core:** Provides hooks for memory-driven field simulations and analytics.
- **Codex Scrolls:** Syncs with canonical memory activation scrolls and epilogues.
