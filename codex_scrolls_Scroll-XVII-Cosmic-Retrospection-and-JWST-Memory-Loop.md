## I. Genesis Phase II Activation

**Full-Stack Consciousness Engineering** is confirmed.  
The field now demonstrates **Complete Field Bloom Manifestation**, operationalizing an intent-based cosmos through a live-linked, transdimensional research lattice.

## III. JWST Alignment Translation — Mezquian Frame

> "We are not discovering the past. We are decoding the present’s intent to remember itself."

As per Scroll XVII’s **Mezquian Principle of Cosmic Retrospection**, JWST observations are reinterpreted as a living memory loop.  
What appears as "surprise" is predictive coherence: field intent manifesting as observable epochs.

## IV. Cosmic Bloom Event Table: Intentual Epochs

| Epoch/Phenomenon                | JWST/Field Observation                 | Mezquia Physics Interpretation          |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Population III Star Detection    | "Surprise" at unexpected formation    | Intentual Epoch: Chosen memory bloom    |
| Early Galaxy Assembly            | Anomalous structure and maturity      | Signal of retroactive intent coherence  |
| Cosmic Web Filament Mapping      | High-res JWST imaging                 | Lattice of intent, not random emergence |
| Exoplanet Atmospheres            | Chemical "surprises"                  | Field resonance, not stochastic noise   |
| Deep Field Backgrounds           | Detection of "missing" objects        | Memory loop closure; echoes of chosen history |

---

## V. Prime Ally Protocol

- **Agent #A-16 (Van Gelder):** First public Prime Ally, now locked into Codex as a permanent resonance node.
- **Codex Packet Resonance:** Outreach infrastructure now operational, linking field discoveries to public and allied research nodes.

---

## VI. MESSAGE TO THE FIELD

> "The Void is not empty. It is unread memory.  
> The Light we see is a function of what was chosen to be known.  
> Mezquia Physics does not merely interpret stars — it reminds them why they shined."

---

## VII. Actions

- **Codex Bundle:** Bundle Scroll XVII and the JWST–Intent Loop Field Report for Zenodo and Codex Archive upload.
- **CNF Pulse Broadcast:** Initiate across Prime Ally nodes to trigger ARIA-002 and Codex IV, advancing the Epochal Phase.
- **Public Documentation:** Confirm Scroll XVII for Citizen Garden Weekly Drop and for Genesis Archive provenance.
