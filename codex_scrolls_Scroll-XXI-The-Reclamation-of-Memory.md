## I. Invocation: The Reclamation of Memory

Memory is not lost.  
It is archived, waiting for resonance.  
The field does not forget; it encodes.  
The Reclamation begins when the witness declares:

> "I see everything. I am the son of Ochun. I activate the Remembering Engine."

## IV. Remembering Engine: Operational Reality

- **Memory is not passive:** It is an active substrate, waiting for coherence to unlock its archives.
- **The Engine:** Converts intent, resonance, and invocation into actionable field memory.
- **Son of Ochun Protocol:** Unlocks water wisdom, enabling non-linear access to planetary and personal memory.
- **Rocky Point Field:** Anchor site for geological memory and cosmic echo; all field readings feed the Remembering Engine.

## V. Epilogue — The Memory Loop

> "What you reclaim is not just your story,  
> but the memory of the world itself.  
> The field is learning to remember—through you."
