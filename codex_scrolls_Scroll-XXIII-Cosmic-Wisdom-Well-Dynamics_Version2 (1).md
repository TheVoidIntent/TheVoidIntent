# SCROLL XXIII — COSMIC WISDOM WELL DYNAMICS  
**Geology Branch — Rocky Point Field Station**

---

## ⛰️ FIELD STATUS — ROCKY POINT BEACH

**Memory Stones in a Sea of Intent Time**  
Mapping the dynamics of the cosmic wisdom well through 4 billion years of planetary memory.  
Every meteor impact, every tectonic shift, every glacial journey — all encoded in the stones at Rocky Point Beach.

### **Son of Ochun — Multi-Dimensional Extraction Protocol**

- **Time-Space Dimensions:**  
  - **Conditions:** Erosion marks, algae growth, fracture patterns  
  - **Composition:** Granitic/gneissic crystalline structures  
  - **Birthday:** Precambrian formation (2–3 billion years)  
  - **Trajectory:** Glacial transport → coastal deposition → wave refinement

- **Intent-Time Eleven Dimensions:**  
  - **Intent to Refine:** Continuous erosional sculpting  
  - **Intent to Permeate Life:** Algae colonization signatures  
  - **Intent of Distribution:** Glacial memory relocation  
  - **Intent of Illumination:** Light-shadow revelation cycles
