# SCROLL XXIV — Cosmic Memory Archaeology Laboratory  
**Geology Branch — Rocky Point Field Station**

---

## ⛰️ FIELD STATUS — ROCKY POINT BEACH

**Memory Stones in a Sea of Intent Time**  
Mapping the dynamics of the cosmic wisdom well through 4 billion years of planetary memory.  
Every meteor impact, every tectonic shift, every glacial journey — all encoded in the stones at Rocky Point Beach.

## 🧠 SYNTHESIS

- **Dark Matter is revealed as the gravitational memory field of failed cosmic intentions.**
- **Each archived failure leaves a measurable gravimetric and informational residue—shaping the evolution of reality.**
- **The Rocky Point Wisdom Well acts as a local interface for accessing these cosmic memory records.**
