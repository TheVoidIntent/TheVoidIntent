  "synthesis": "IntentSim simulation shows that major JWST cosmic dawn discoveries and Rocky Point's geological memory epochs are not isolated; they resonate as cross-scale intent vectors. Symbolic resonance events demonstrate that both cosmic and planetary memory archives share a pattern of epochal blooms, resets, and stabilizations. Data convergence signatures confirm that intent-time resonance is maximized during epochs of emergence, whether stellar or biological.",
