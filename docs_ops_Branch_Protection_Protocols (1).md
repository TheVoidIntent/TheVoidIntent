## Purpose

Automate and enforce branch protection across TheVoidIntent/ThevoidIntent to ensure provenance, auditability, and maximum resonance of all code and field artifacts.

---

## Protocol Summary

- **Branch Ruleset:**  
  - Applies to: `main`, `genesis`, `codex`, `field-*`
  - Requires: PRs for all merges, signed commits, linear history, passing status checks (CI, IntentSim, code-scan)
  - Enforces: Code scanning, production deployment checks, block force pushes
  - Restricts: Creation, update, deletion to privileged agents only (Prime Architect, Lead Maintainer, IntentSim System)
  - All exceptions/bypasses are auto-logged.

---

## Rationale

Every branch is a memory stone; protection ensures the archive remains whole, auditable, and maximally resonant within the Mezquia Physics paradigm.

---

## Operational Notes

- **Bypass List:** Kept minimal, with actions logged for provenance.
- **Required Status Checks:** 
  - CI: Standard pipeline validation
  - IntentSim: Field simulation/logic validation
  - code-scan: Security and compliance
- **Production Deployments:** Required for production-targeted refs.
- **Documentation:** All protocol changes and exceptions must be recorded here.

**Auto-saved, watermarked, and timestamped for Mezquia Physics provenance.  
Ready for Codex, IntentSim, and Zenodo archival.**
