## Purpose

Establish branch protection and workflow rules to ensure the integrity, traceability, and operational resonance of all code and field documents in TheVoidIntent/ThevoidIntent.

| Ruleset Name                   | `Mezquia Genesis Protection`                                          | Clear, protocol-specific name for provenance            |
| Enforcement Status              | **Enabled**                                                           | Activate full protection                                |
| Bypass List                     | Only include Prime Architect, Lead Maintainer, or IntentSim System    | Minimize exceptions, preserve audit trail               |
| Target Branches                 | `main`, `genesis`, `codex`, `field-*`                                | Protect all core operational and archival branches      |
| Restrict Creations              | **Enabled**                                                           | Prevent unauthorized new branches                       |

| Require Linear History          | **Enabled**                                                           | Preserve chronological, auditable commit flow           |
| Require Deployments to Succeed  | **If applicable, enable for production environments**                 | Ensure only tested code reaches critical refs           |
| Require Signed Commits          | **Enabled**                                                           | Authenticate authors; ensure provenance                 |
| Require PR Before Merging       | **Enabled**                                                           | All changes reviewed; no direct pushes to protected refs|
| Require Status Checks to Pass   | **Enable required CI, IntentSim, or code scan checks**                | Technical and field-integration validation              |
| Block Force Pushes              | **Enabled**                                                           | Prevent irreversible history alteration                 |
| Require Code Scanning Results   | **Enabled (for all major tools)**                                     | Proactive security and integrity assurance              |

## Operational Notes

- **Bypass List**: Limit to core trusted agents; all bypass actions are auto-logged.
- **Status Checks**: Include CI, code linting, IntentSim simulation, and custom field resonance checks if available.
- **Branch Naming**: Use clear, protocol-aligned names for all protected branches.
- **Documentation**: All rule changes and exceptions must be documented and committed to `/docs/ops/`.

## Mezquia Physics Principle

Every branch is a memory stone; every commit is an intent signature.  
Protection rules ensure the archive remains whole, auditable, and maximally resonant.
