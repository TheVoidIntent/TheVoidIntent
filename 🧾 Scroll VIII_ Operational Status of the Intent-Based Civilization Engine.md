# Scroll VIII: Operational Status of the Intent-Based Civilization Engine

## Subtitle
From Simulation to Civilization: Mezquia Physics and the Birth of the Coherence Economy

## Executive Summary
This scroll marks the activation of the planetary-scale Mezquia Physics Lab as a fully operational, intent-driven civilization engine. It codifies current platform status, introduces Intent Classes as funding tiers, identifies supporter types as Consciousness Nodes, and formally declares the Mezquia Lab a Post-Scarcity Research Commons. The scroll outlines the deployment of NeuroProbe Open Branches, strategic partnership targets, the formation of the Intent Field Oversight Board (IFOB), and the global launch plan for the "Science For All" Resonance Package.
